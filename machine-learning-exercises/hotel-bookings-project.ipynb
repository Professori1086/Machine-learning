They have noticed that the cancellation rate has risen in the past few years. This often leads to rooms that are left unrented for multiple days at a time.\n\nHotel management is interested in developing a model to predict the likelihood that a customer will cancel their reservation. If successful, this could be used to optimize their booking service and anticipate when cancellations will occur.\n\nYou will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.","metadata":{},"id":"5a0a52d9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"THIS IS THE FIRST PRACTISE PROJECT.
